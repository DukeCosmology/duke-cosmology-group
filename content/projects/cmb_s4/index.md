CMB-S4 is the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment.
With 12 telescopes at the South Pole and in the Chilean Atacama desert surveying the sky with 500,000 cryogenically-cooled superconducting detectors for 7-10 years, CMB-S4 will deliver transformative discoveries in fundamental physics, cosmology, astrophysics, and astronomy.
