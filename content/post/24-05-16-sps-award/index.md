Congratulations to [Dennis Wu](https://cosmology.phy.duke.edu/author/dennis-wu/) for receiving the [2024 Jocelyn Bell Burnell outstanding leadership scholarship](https://www.spsnational.org/scholarships/jocelynn-bell-burnell/recipients/2024) awarded by the Society of Physics Students (SPS).
Each year, one student in the entire US is awarded this scholarship based on their academic performance and leadership.

It is also worth noting that earlier in 2024, the Duke chapter of the SPS won an Outstanding Chapter Award from the SPS national office.
This designation is given to fewer than 10 percent of all SPS chapters at colleges and universities in the United States and internationally.
