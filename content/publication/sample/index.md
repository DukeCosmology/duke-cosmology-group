abstract: We present a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing
        observations from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), with
        redshift-space galaxy clustering observations from the Baryon
        Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and galaxy-galaxy
        lensing observations from the overlap between KiDS-1000, BOSS,
        and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey. This
        combination of large-scale structure probes breaks the
        degeneracies between cosmological parameters for individual
        observables, resulting in a constraint on the structure growth
        parameter S$_{8}$ = {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}${\ensuremath{\sqr
        t{}}}({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$/0.3) =
        0.766$_{-0.014}$$^{+0.020}$, which has the same overall
        precision as that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave
        background observations from Planck. The recovered S$_{8}$
        amplitude is low, however, by 8.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.6\%
        relative to Planck. This result builds from a series of
        KiDS-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology with
        variable depth mock galaxy surveys, our lensing calibration with
        image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-
        infrared redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues
        and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering analysis. The
        systematic uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded
        through as nuisance parameters in our cosmological analysis.
        Inspecting the offset between the marginalised posterior
        distributions, we find that the S$_{8}$-difference with Planck
        is driven by a tension in the matter fluctuation amplitude
        parameter, {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$. We quantify the level of
        agreement between the cosmic microwave background and our large-
        scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics,
        finding differences with a significance ranging between
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, when considering the
        offset in S$_{8}$, and
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}2{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, when considering the
        full multi-dimensional parameter space.
