I have obtained my Master's degree in Subatomic Physics and Cosmology at University Grenoble-Alpes.
I am now a 3rd year PhD student in Cosmology at Centre de Physique des Particules de Marseille (CPPM) in France, under the supervision of D. Fouchez, B. Racine and J. Bautista.

My research focuses on the measurement of the growth rate of structures using Type Ia Supernovae.
I am mostly involved in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) but I am also working in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) framework within the Dark Energy Science Collaboraration (DESC).

During my PhD I am doing teaching duties as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the physics departement of Aix-Marseille University (AMU).
