Sidney is a postdoctoral associate working with the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) collaboration, the [Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/) Legacy Survey of Space and Time [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/), and the [Roman Cosmology with High Latitude Imaging Survey Project Infrastructure Team (Roman HLIS PIT)](https://roman-hlis-cosmology.caltech.edu/) for the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
Sidney uses image simulations to help these experiments achieve the systematic precision necessary to measure weak lensing cosmic shear for cosmology.
