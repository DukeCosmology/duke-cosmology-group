I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics, Duke University.

My research field is Cosmology, the study of origin and evolution of the Universe.
I am interested in answering the questions about the distribution of (dark) matter in the Universe, also known as the large-scale structure and using it to understand the contents (dark matter and dark energy) of the Universe.
I study the matter distribution using a technique called Weak Gravitational Lensing.
On a day-to-day basis, I work on image processing pipelines and algorithms that work at raw pixel-level data to extract useful information from millions (soon to be billions) of galaxies namely galaxy fluxes (and colors) and shapes.
