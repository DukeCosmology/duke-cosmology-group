I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Physics, Duke University and am pursuing my postdoctoral research at Princeton University.
I am a member of the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) collaboration and the Project Infrastructure Team for the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/). I am part of these collaborations to answer the big questions in science such as _what is the Universe made of?_ and _how did the Universe grow?_. I am particularly interested in answering the questions about the distribution of (dark) matter in the Universe, also known as the large-scale structure and using it to understand the contents (dark matter and dark energy) of the Universe. I study the matter distribution using a phenomenon called Weak Gravitational Lensing, which is the apparent distortion of galaxy shapes seen in images, caused by massive gravitational potential in the Universe.

<!--
My PhD focuses on addressing observational systematics in weak gravitational lensing (WL) cosmology, primarily through the current-generation Dark Energy Survey (DES) and upcoming near-infrared surveys like Roman. I co-led the shear catalog and image simulations analysis team in DES, achieving significant strides in reducing shear calibration bias. Our team successfully created the largest WL shape catalog to date, containing over hundres of millions of galaxy shapes. Concurrently, I also co-lead the cosmic shear cosmological analysis team in DES, substantially increasing the signal-to-noise ratio compared to previous DES analyses. Turning towards future space-based missions, I identified and addressed the challenges posed by the undersampled images in the Roman telescope. I leveraged an underutilized technique called IMage COMbination (IMCOM) to reconstruct properly sampled images, thus allowing for more precise shear calibration. Our methodology has been demonstrated to be feasible and efficient, utilizing only a minimal portion of the error budget for shear bias.
