I am a cosmologist focusing on astrophysical systematics in weak lensing measurements, exploring their impact on late-time cosmology. My work involves statistical modeling, systematics mitigation, and advancing methods for precision cosmology.

I contribute to the LSST DESC and the NASA Roman Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT). I focus on cosmological inference and weak lensing analysis.

My previous work includes contributions to the XENON collaboration, where I designed the electric field cage of the XENONnT detector.
