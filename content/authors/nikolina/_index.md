Nikolina (Niko) Šarčević is a cosmologist specializing in astrophysical systematics in weak lensing measurements, examining their impact on late-time cosmology. Her work encompasses statistical modeling, systematics mitigation, and advancing methods for precision cosmology.

She is an active contributor to the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) and the NASA Roman Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT), with a focus on cosmological inference and weak lensing analysis.

Previously, she contributed to the XENON collaboration, where she played a key role in designing the electric field cage of the XENONnT detector.
