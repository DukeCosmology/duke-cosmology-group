I am a postdoc associate at the department of Physics, Duke University. My current research interests broadly fall in the domain of Large Scale Structure (LSS) and Cosmology. More specifically, I am interested in multiprobe joint analysis of LSS, assembly bias of galaxies, strong lensing of galaxies and type-Ia supernovae.

My expertise is to use the technique of weak gravitational lensing to observationally quantify the amount and distribution of dark matter in galaxies. These observations allow me to constrain phenomenological models of connection between galaxies and their host dark-matter halos. I also focus on how robust such inferences are against the systematic and statistical uncertainties in the derived galaxy properties. I have previously worked on galaxy-halo connection of HSC (deepest stage III wide area imaging survey) photometric galaxies.

In my current role, I am a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) and NASA's Roman High Lattitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT).
