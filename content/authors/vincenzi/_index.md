I am an Enstein Fellow at the Department of Physics, Duke University. 

I'm a cosmologist and I try to understand how our Universe is expanding using Type Ia Supernovae. I'm currently the lead of the cosmological analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova sample, the largest and deepest SN sample from single telescope ever compiled.

I'm also actively working to the design and planning of the LSST and I'm the co-convener of the Time Domain Working Group within the LSST-Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST-DESC).
