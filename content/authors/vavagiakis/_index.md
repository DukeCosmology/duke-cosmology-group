I’m an Assistant Professor at Duke University in the Department of Physics. I’m building a lab and looking to work with students excited about experimental cosmology instrumentation and data analysis, so please get in touch if you’re interested. I work as a part of four collaborations: ACT, CCAT-prime, CMB-S4, and SO.
